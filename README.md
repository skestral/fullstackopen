## Part 0 - [Fundamentals of Web apps](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0)

> Status: **Completed** on February 22, 2025

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the practicalities of taking the course. After that, we will have an overview of the basics of web development and also talk about the advances in web application development during the last few decades.

- [0.4 new note](/Part-0/0.4-newNoteDiagram/) - The diagram shows how communicate the browser and the server when user added a note to a page containing JavaScript.
- [0.5single page app](/Part-0/0.5-singlePageAppDiagram/) - The diagram shows the communication between the browser and the server when user opened single page app on the browser.
- [0.6 new note (single page app)](/Part-0/0.6-newNoteSinglePageAppDiagram/) - The diagram shows how communicate the browser and the server when user added a note to a single page app.

## Part 1 - [Introduction to React](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1)

> Status: **In Progress**

This part introduces to _React_ concepts. It covers the basics: components, props, _JSX_ and more advanced concepts: _Javascript_ functionalities that are used a lot in _React_ (`.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`), destructuring, event handlers in _React_ and passing state to child components, spread operator, hooks and their rules and conditional rendering.

## Part 2 - [Communicating with server](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2)

> Status: **Pending**

This part covers how to display list items in _React_ and how to handle forms. Introduces _JSON server_ and fetching data from it, _axios_ for sending `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE` requests and how to style your _React_ app (CSS).

## Part 3 - [Programming a server with NodeJS and Express](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3)

> Status: **Pending**

This part is focused on the backend. How to: implement a simple _REST API_ in _Node.js_ using _Express_, connect to a database (_MongoDB_) to store and retrieve data, deploy your app.

[{() => fs} Part 3 Solutions Folder](/Part-03)

## Part 4 - [Testing Express servers, user administration](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4)

> Status: **Pending**

This part is focused on testing _Node.js_ applications, async/await, user administration, references across collections, token based authentication.

[{() => fs} Part 4 Solutions Folder](/Part-04)

## Part 5 - [Testing React apps](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5)

> Status: **Pending**

This part is focused on token based authentication and testing the _React_ components using _Jest_, _React Testing Library_ and _Cypress_.

[{() => fs} Part 5 Solutions Folder](/Part-05)

## Part 6 - [State management with Redux](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part6)

> Status: **Pending**

This part is focused on _Redux_, which can be used for more complex state management of your _React_ app (covers concepts like immutability, global store, actions and reducers). Also this chapter covers how to use _Redux_ with `hooks`, and how to use the old `connect` higher order component when you work on older code bases, and `redux thunk` for asynchronous code.

[{() => fs} Part 6 Solutions Folder](/Part-06)

## Part 7 - [React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7)

> Status: **Pending**

This part handles a lot of different subjects. Such as _React router_ (with hooks) which used to navigate in _React_ apps, how to create custom hooks, ways to style an app and which UI libraries can be used. This part also covers how to use _Webpack_ instead of Create-React-App to setup an app, and gives a short overview of class components.

[{() => fs} Part 7 Solutions Folder](/Part-07)

## Part 8 - [GraphQL](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part8)

> Status: **Pending**

This part is about _GraphQL_, Facebook's alternative to _REST API_ for communication between browser and server. In this parts covered basic GraphQL concepts like `schema`, `queries` and `resolver` also how to setup and use [Apollo's](https://www.apollographql.com/) `ApolloServer` and `ApolloClient`.

[{() => fs} Part 8 Solutions Folder](/Part-08)

## Part 9 - [TypeScript](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9)

> Status: **Pending**

In this part, we will be using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem, with predefined linters and an existing codebase, while writing TypeScript. After doing this part, you should be able to understand, develop and configure projects using TypeScript.

## Part 10 - [React Native](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part10)

> Status: **Pending**

This part is about how to build native Android and iOS mobile applications with _JavaScript_ and _React_ using the _React Native_ framework. By developing an entire mobile application from scratch this part gives a good dive into the _React Native_ ecosystem. It covers concepts such as how to render native user interface components with _React Native_, how to create beautiful user interfaces, how to communicate with a server, and how to test a _React Native_ application.

## Part 11 - [CI/CD](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11)

> Status: **Pending**

This part shows and explains of why you should use _Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) system_ and what can it do for you. And how to get started with _[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)_.

[{() => fs} Part 11 Solutions Folder](/Part-11)

## Part 12 - [Containers](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part12)

> Status: **Pending**

In this part, we will learn how to package code into standard units of software called containers. These containers can help us develop software faster and easier than before. Along the way, we will also explore a completely new viewpoint for web development, outside of the now-familiar Node.js backend and React frontend.

## Part 13 - [Using relational databases](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part13)

> Status: **Pending**

In the previous sections of the course we used MongoDB for storing data, which is a so called NoSQL database. NoSQL databases became very common just over 10 years ago, when the scaling of the internet started to produce problems for relational databases that utilized the older generation SQL query language.
