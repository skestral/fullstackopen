- [ ] [anecdotes](anecdotes)


> [!NOTE]
> For each part of the course, there is a directory, which further branches into directories containing a series of exercises, like "unicafe" for part 1.  
> 
> Most of the exercises of the course build a larger application, eg. courseinfo, unicafe and anecdotes in this part, bit by bit. It is enough to submit the completed application. You can make a commit after each exercise, but that is not compulsory. For example the course info app is built in exercises 1.1.-1.5. It is just the end result after 1.5 that you need to submit!

## 1.1 - 1.5 [courseinfo](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/introduction_to_react#exercises-1-1-1-2)

> Status: **Completed** on February 28, 2025


The application that we will start working on in this exercise will be further developed in a few of the following exercises. In this and other upcoming exercise sets in this course, it is enough to only submit the final state of the application. If desired, you may also create a commit for each exercise of the series, but this is entirely optional.
